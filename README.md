# React-Native-Pesticide-Project

 The idea of this project is to create a simple calculator for pesticide workers (ex. exterminators) to use. Example calculations include: calculating volume of a particular building, calculating how much spray mix (pesticide) is needed for a building of such volume, etc. The calculations are actually very easy but the idea is to make it simple and user friendly.
